        I have watched <i>many</i> different animes through my life. 
        There is <i>always</i> a debate on what the best anime is for every year or even in all time but, 
        I will be talking about <b>my</b> favorites that I have watched.
        Anime has been something I have been watching since I was young and as someone in their 
        early 20s now, I have seen many different ones in many different genres. 
        Below I will be talking about my <b>favorites</b>.
